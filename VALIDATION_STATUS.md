# Validation Status Report (Round 2)

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Auditor:** Agent (SIG Validator)

## Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY (HARDENED)

The second round of auditing and refactoring has successfully sanitized the internal configuration files (`*.properties`), removing the last traces of hardcoded credentials.

### 1. Security Validation
- [x] **Properties Sanitization**: `application.properties`, `application-docker.properties`, and `global.properties` have been stripped of hardcoded passwords (`Solution.2021!`, `secret-@-sercret`, etc.) and now strictly rely on environment variables.
- [x] **Default Fail-Safety**: The removal of defaults (e.g., `${...:defaultValue}`) means the application will rightfully fail to start if secrets are not provided, preventing insecure deployments.

### 2. Configuration Validation
- [x] **Environment Variables**: The system now requires the following variables to be set in `.env` or the runtime environment:
    - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
    - `MAIL_PASSWORD`
    - `REDIS_PASSWORD`
    - `JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD`
    - `GEOSERVER_REST_PASSWORD`
- [x] **Logging**: SQL logging (`show-sql`) has been disabled in the Docker profile to prevent log leakage.

### 3. Documentation
- [x] **CHANGELOG.md**: Updated with Round 2 fixes.

### 4. Critical Fixes
- [x] **Frontend Dependencies**: Restored missing `sig_frontend/package.json` file which was causing Docker build failures. Reconstructed dependencies based on `nuxt.config.js`.

## Conclusion
The application is now significantly more secure. It is no longer possible to run the backend with "default" insecure credentials. Deployment now **requires** proper configuration management.
